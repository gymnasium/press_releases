        Modern Web Design is perfect for designers, aspiring front-end developers,
        and other creatives who want to expand their skills and take their career to a new level.
        In six hours of instruction, students will learn how to mark up content with semantic HTML,
        use CSS as a design tool, and add interactivity to web pages with JavaScript.

        Beyond the basics, you will also learn how to build a responsive website that
        works seamlessly on all devices and platforms. Upon completion of this course,
        you will have built a multi-page responsive website that utilizes all of your new skills.
        <p>
        The only prerequisites for this course are familiarity with the web and experience with a text editor such as Sublime Text, Atom, BBEdit, etc.
